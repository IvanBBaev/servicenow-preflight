/**
 * DF-0 — capability preflight.
 *
 * The script-intelligence, flow and codecheck tools read admin-restricted
 * `sys_*` tables (`sys_script`, `sys_script_include`, `sys_security_acl`, …). A
 * true least-privilege integration user often cannot read them, so a tool that
 * "reads the instance's code" can return a silently empty result on a governed
 * instance even though it dazzles on a PDI (COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS R1/R2). This
 * module probes, up front, which of those tables the connected user can
 * actually read and maps the result to the higher-level capabilities that
 * depend on them — so the assistant never promises a read it cannot make.
